In the last quarter of the 20th century, a new family of carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions based on transition-metal catalysts evolved as powerful tools in synthesis. Among them, the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are the most prominent. In this Review, highlights of a number of selected syntheses are discussed.

  abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), comprising of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The cholinergic system has been suggested as the earliest and most affected molecular mechanism that describes AD pathophysiology. Moreover, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are the potential class of drugs that can amplify cholinergic activity to improve cognition and global performance and reduce psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Approximately, 60\%-80\% of all cases of dementia in the world are patients with AD. In view of the continuous rise of this disease especially in the aged population, there is a dire need to come up with a novel compound and/or mixture that could work against this devastating disease. In this regard, the best is to rely on natural compounds rather than synthetic ones, because natural compounds are easily available, cost-effective, and comparatively less toxic. To serve this purpose, lately, scientific community has started exploring the possibility of using different polyphenols either solitary or in combination that can serve as therapeutics against AD. In the current article, we have summarized the role of various polyphenols, namely quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin, gallocatechins, cinnamic acid, caffeine, and caffeic acid as an inhibitor of cholinesterase for the treatment of AD. We have also tried to uncover the mechanistic insight on the action of these polyphenols against AD pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {Beta-amyloid peptide is considered to be responsible for the formation of senile plaques that accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. There has been compelling evidence supporting the idea that beta-amyloid-induced cytotoxicity is mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). Considerable attention has been focused on identifying phytochemicals that are able to scavenge excess ROIs, thereby protecting against oxidative stress and cell death. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a phytoalexin found in the skin of grapes, has strong antioxidative properties that have been associated with the protective effects of red wine consumption against coronary heart disease ("the French paradox"). In this study, we have investigated the effects of resveratrol on beta-amyloid-induced oxidative cell death in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. PC12 cells treated with beta-amyloid exhibited increased accumulation of intracellular ROI and underwent apoptotic death as determined by characteristic morphological alterations and positive in situ terminal end-labeling (TUNEL staining). Beta-amyloid treatment also led to the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, the cleavage of poly(ADPribose)polymerase, an increase in the Bax/Bcl-X-L ratio, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Resveratrol attenuated beta-amyloid-induced cytotoxicity, apoptotic features, and intracellular ROI accumulation. Beta-amyloid transiently induced activation of NF-kappaB in PC12 cells, which was suppressed by resveratrol pretreatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we demonstrate the atypical in vitro activity of human FMO5 as a Baeyer-Villiger mono-oxygenase on a broad range of substrates, revealing the first example to date of a human protein catalyzing such reactions. The isolated and purified protein was active on diverse carbonyl compounds, whereas soft nucleophiles were mostly non- or poorly reactive.

Until recently, the functions of the five human FMO isoforms were mostly linked to their capability of oxygenating molecules containing soft N- and S-nucleophiles. However, the human FMO isoform 5 was recently shown to feature an atypical activity as Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase. With the aim of evaluating such an alternative entry point in the metabolism of active pharmaceutical ingredients, we selected and tested drug molecules bearing a carbonyl group on an aliphatic chain. Nabumetone and pentoxifylline, two widely used pharmaceuticals, were thereby demonstrated to be efficiently oxidized in vitro by FMO5 to the corresponding acetate esters with high selectivity. The proposed pathways explain the formation of a predominant plasma metabolite of pentoxifylline as well as the crucial transformation of the pro-drug nabumetone into the pharmacologically active compound. Using the recombinant enzyme, the ester derivatives of both drugs were obtained in milligram amounts, purified, and fully characterized. This protocol can potentially be extended to other FMO5 candidate substrates as it represents an effective and robust bench-ready platform applicable to API screening and metabolite synthesis.},

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The development of a cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been impeded by an inability to pinpoint the root cause of this disorder. Although numerous potential pathological factors have been indicated, acting either individually or mutually, the molecular mechanisms leading to disease onset and progression have not been clear. Amyloid-beta (A beta), generated from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and its aggregated forms, particularly oligomers, are suggested as key pathological features in AD-affected brains. Historically, highly concentrated metals are found colocalized within A beta plaques. Metal binding to A beta (metal-A beta) generates/stabilizes potentially toxic A beta oligomers, and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro (redox active metal ions; plausible contribution to oxidative stress). Consequently, clarification of the relationship between A beta, metal ions, and toxicity, including oxidative stress via metal-A beta, can lead to a deeper understanding of AD development. To probe the involvement of metal-A beta in AD pathogenesis, rationally designed and naturally occurring molecules have been examined as chemical tools to target metal-A beta species, modulate the interaction between the metal and A beta, and subsequently redirect their aggregation into nontoxic, off-pathway unstructured aggregates. These ligands are also capable of attenuating the generation of redox active metal-A beta-induced ROS to mitigate oxidative stress. One rational design concept, the incorporation approach, installs a metal binding site into a framework known to interact with A beta. This approach affords compounds with the simultaneous ability to chelate metal ions and interact with A beta. Natural products capable of A beta interaction have been investigated for their influence on metal-induced A beta aggregation and have inspired the construction of synthetic analogues. Systematic studies of these synthetic or natural molecules could uncover relationships between chemical structures, metal/A beta/metal-A beta interactions, and inhibition of A beta/metal-A beta reactivity (i.e., aggregation modes of A beta/metal-A beta; associated ROS production), suggesting mechanisms to refine the design strategy. Interdisciplinary investigations have demonstrated that the designed molecules and natural products control the aggregation pathways of metal-A beta species transforming their size/conformation distribution. The aptitude of these molecules to impact metal-A beta aggregation pathways, either via inhibition of A beta aggregate formation, most importantly of oligomers, or disaggregation of preformed fibrils, could originate from their formation of complexes with metal-A beta. Potentially, these molecules could direct metal-A beta size/conformational states into alternative nontoxic unstructured oligomers, and control the geometry at the A beta-ligated metal center for limited ROS formation to lessen the overall toxicity induced by metal-A beta. Complexation between small molecules and A beta/metal-A beta has been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) pointing to molecular level interactions, validating the design strategy. In addition, these molecules exhibit other attractive properties, such as antioxidant capacity, prevention of ROS production, potential blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and reduction of A beta-/metal-A beta-induced cytotoxicity, making them desirable tools for unraveling AD complexity. In this Account, we summarize the recent development of small molecules, via both rational design and the selection and modification of natural products, as tools for investigating metal-A beta complexes, to advance our understanding of their relation to AD pathology.},

Multifunctional compounds able to modulate the reactivities of various pathological features, such as amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation, metal ion dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress, have emerged as useful tactic. Recently, an incorporation approach to the rational design of multipurpose small molecules has been validated through the production of a multifunctional ligand (ML) as a potential chemical tool for AD. In order to further the development of more diverse and improved multifunctional reagents, essential pharmacophores must be identified. Herein, we report a series of aminoquinoline derivatives (AQ1-4, AQP1-4, and AQDA1-3) based on ML's framework, prepared to gain a structure reactivity understanding of ML's multifunctionality in addition to tuning its metal binding affinity. Our structure reactivity investigations have implicated the dimethylamino group as a key component for supplying the antiamyloidogenic characteristics of ML in both the absence and presence of metal ions. Two-dimensional NMR studies indicate that structural variations of ML could tune its interaction sites along the A beta sequence. In addition, mass spectrometric analyses suggest that the ability of our aminoquinoline derivatives to regulate metal-induced A beta aggregation may be influenced by their metal binding properties. Moreover, structural modifications to ML were also observed to noticeably change its metal binding affinities and metal-to-ligand stoichiometries that were shown to be linked to their antiamyloidogenic and antioxidant activities. Overall, our studies provide new insights into rational design strategies for multifunctional ligands directed at regulating metal ions, A beta, and oxidative stress in AD and could advance the development of improved next-generation multifunctional reagents.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease acknowledged as progressive multifarious neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in late adult life. Pathologically it is characterized by intracellular nenrofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloidal protein deposits contributing to senile plaques. Over the last two decades, advances in the field of pathogenesis have inspired the researchers for the investigation of novel pharmacological therapeutics centered more towards the pathophysiological events of the disease. Currently available treatments i.e. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, galantamine, donepezil) and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine) contribute minimal impact on the disease and target late aspects of the disease. These drugs decelerate the progression of the disease, provide symptomatic relief but fail to achieve a definite cure. While the neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease are recognized but the intricacies of the mechanism have not been clearly defined. This lack of understanding regarding the pathogenic process may be the likely reason for the non-availability of effective treatment which can prevent onset and progression of the disease. Owing to the important progress in the field of pathophysiology in the last couple of years, new therapeutic targets are available that should render the underlying disease process to be tackled directly. In this review, authors will discusses the different aspects of pathophysiological mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease and its management through conventional drug therapy, including modern investigational therapeutic strategies, recently completed and ongoing.

This member of the LDL receptor superfamily is constitutively endocytosed from the membrane and recycled back to the cell surface. Its many functions were long thought to involve its ability to bind over 30 different ligands and deliver them to lysosomes for degradation. However, LRP has since been shown to interact with scaffolding and signaling proteins via its intracellular domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and to function as a co-receptor partnering with other cell surface or integral membrane proteins. This multi-talented receptor has been implicated in regulation of platelet derived growth factor receptor activity, integrin maturation and recycling, and focal adhesion disassembly. These functions may account for recent studies identifying LRP's role in protection of the vasculature, regulation of cell migration, and modulation of the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.},

In this process, one molecule (monomer) of a soluble protein interacts with other monomers of the same protein to form dimers, oligomers, and polymers. Conformation changes in three-dimensional structure of the protein, especially the formation of beta-strands, often accompany the process. Eventually, as the size of the aggregates increases, they may precipitate as insoluble amyloid fibrils, in which the structure is stabilized by the p-strands interacting within a beta-sheet. In this review, we discuss this theme as it relates to the two most common neurodegenerative conditions-Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.},

  abstract = {Amyloid-beta (A beta) is best known as the misfolded peptide that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it is currently the primary therapeutic target in attempts to arrest the course of this disease. This notoriety has overshadowed evidence that A beta serves several important physiological functions. A beta is present throughout the lifespan, it has been found in all vertebrates examined thus far, and its molecular sequence shows a high degree of conservation. These features are typical of a factor that contributes significantly to biological fitness, and this suggestion has been supported by evidence of functions that are beneficial for the brain. The putative roles of A beta include protecting the body from infections, repairing leaks in the blood-brain barrier, promoting recovery from injury, and regulating synaptic function. Evidence for these beneficial roles comes from in vitro and in vivo studies, which have shown that the cellular production of A beta rapidly increases in response to a physiological challenge and often diminishes upon recovery. These roles are further supported by the adverse outcomes of clinical trials that have attempted to deplete A beta in order to treat AD. We suggest that anti-A beta therapies will produce fewer adverse effects if the known triggers of A beta deposition (e.g., pathogens, hypertension, and diabetes) are addressed first.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveDementia is an important cause of mortality and, with the ageing population and increasing prevalence of dementia, reliable data on prognosis and survival will be of interest to patients and caregivers as well as providers and commissioners of health and social care. A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the rates of survival in dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to identify factors that are or are not predictive of mortality in dementia and AD. MethodsRelevant articles on mortality in dementia were identified following a search of several electronic databases from 1990 to September 2012. Inclusion criteria were reports on prospective community or clinic based cohorts published in English since 1990, to reflect more recent recognition of possible predictors. ResultsMedian survival time from age of onset of dementia ranges from 3.3 to 11.7years, with most studies in the 7 to 10-year period. Median survival time from age of disease diagnosis ranges from 3.2 to 6.6years for dementia or AD cohorts as a whole. Age was consistently reported as a predictor of mortality, with male gender a less consistent predictor. Increased disease severity and functional impairment were often associated with mortality. ConclusionsSubstantial heterogeneity in the design of included studies limits the ability to prognosticate for individual patients. However, it is clear that dementia and AD are associated with significant mortality. Reasons for the increased mortality are not established. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The development of new bioconjugates formed by one antibody optimally bound (through its Fc region) to fairly inert solid surfaces is of primary relevance in immuno-afﬁnity chromatography. Immunoglobulins G (IgG) have a Fc region very rich in histidine (His) residues. In this way, immobilization of IgGs on heterofunctional metal chelate-glyoxyl supports (Ag–Me2+/G) takes place in two steps: ﬁrstly the antibodies are conjugated to the support via His–metal coordination bonds. Secondly, their incubation under alkaline condition promotes an intramolecular covalent attachment between lysine residues at the Fc region and glyoxyl groups on the support surface. The IgG that recognizes as antigen the HRP (antiHRP–IgG) has been conjugated to Ag–Me2+/G supports. The resulting bioconjugate is highly inert and able to speciﬁcally bind the antigen (HRP) without signiﬁcant unspeciﬁc binding of any other proteins, resulting in an excellent HRP puriﬁcation platform. The binding activity of this bioconjugate has been optimized by controlling the antibody distribution throughout the bead’s surface in order to avoid high antibody densities that led to a low binding activity of the antibodies. The optimal antibody distribution has been achieved when these proteins were slowly immobilized on Ag–Cu2+/G in presence of imidazole. This bioconjugate was able to bind up to 1.5 moles of antigen per mole of antibody, only 1.3-fold less than the antibody in solution. Hence, we have been able to develop an optimal protocol to prepare bioconjugated composites in an oriented and irreversible fashion which results in highly efﬁcient and speciﬁc surfaces for the exclusive biological recognition.},

  abstract = {Crosslinked N,N -Diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups containing dextran microbeads have been used in human serum albumin (HSA) adsorption-desorption studies. For the HSA adsorption onto positively charged hydrophilic DEAE dextran microbeads, the adsorption kinetic was slightly decreased by the changing concentration of the protein solution. Adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of HSA on crosslinked DEAE dextran have been determined experimentally. Modeling of the adsorption processes on DEAE dextran microbeads were realized by applying different adsorption isotherms. Among the several isotherm equations, Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms were investigated depending on the two temperatures. These were only slightly dependent on the initial concentration of HSA but were considerably affected by the pH of the medium. The HSA adsorption capacity factor and the adsorption equilibrium constant were obtained and mathematical modeling of adsorption, adsorption rate constants and maximum adsorption were determined. Besides the adsorption mechanism, optimum ionic strength and optimum pH also were investigated. Desorption studies and desorption ratio of the system were determined for optimum medium conditions. It was been proved both experimentally and theoretically that human HSA is adsorbed by electrostatic attraction, ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction and/or hydrogen bonding.},

  abstract = {Immunoglobulin G is an important plasma protein with many applications in therapeutics and diagnostics, which can be purified effectively by ion exchange chromatography. The ligand densities and pore properties of ion-exchange resins have significant effects on the separation behaviors of protein, however, the understandings are quite limited. In this work, with bovine immunoglobulin as the model IgG, the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics were investigated systematically with series of diethylaminoethyl ion-exchange resins with different ligand densities and pore sizes. The Langmuir equation and pore diffusion model were used to fit the experimental data. The influences of ligand density and pore size on the saturated adsorption capacity, the dissociation constant and the effective diffusivity were discussed. The adsorption capacities increased with the increase of ligand density and the decrease of pore size, and an integrative parameter was proposed to describe the combined effects of ligand density and pore size. It was also found that the effective pore diffusion coefficient of the adsorption kinetics was influenced by pore sizes of resins, but was relatively independent on the ligand densities of resins. For a given protein, the ligand density and pore size should be optimized for improving the protein adsorption.},
