	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is a progressive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers, and neurofibrillary tangles ({NFTs}), comprising of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The cholinergic system has been suggested as the earliest and most affected molecular mechanism that describes {AD} pathophysiology. Moreover, cholinesterase inhibitors ({ChEIs}) are the potential class of drugs that can amplify cholinergic activity to improve cognition and global performance and reduce psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Approximately, 60\%-80\% of all cases of dementia in the world are patients with {AD}. In view of the continuous rise of this disease especially in the aged population, there is a dire need to come up with a novel compound and/or mixture that could work against this devastating disease. In this regard, the best is to rely on natural compounds rather than synthetic ones, because natural compounds are easily available, cost-effective, and comparatively less toxic. To serve this purpose, lately, scientific community has started exploring the possibility of using different polyphenols either solitary or in combination that can serve as therapeutics against {AD}. In the current article, we have summarized the role of various polyphenols, namely quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin, gallocatechins, cinnamic acid, caffeine, and caffeic acid as an inhibitor of cholinesterase for the treatment of {AD}. We have also tried to uncover the mechanistic insight on the action of these polyphenols against {AD} pathogenicity.},

	abstract = {L'acetilcolinesterasi ({AChE}) è un enzima appartenente alla classe delle idrolasi che catalizza la seguente reazione:
acetilcolina + H2O → colina + acetato
L'enzima è normalmente presente nell'organismo dei mammiferi localizzato nella membrana post-sinaptica delle giunzioni colinergiche. La sua funzione è quella di idrolizzare l'acetilcolina scindendola in colina e acido acetico.
L'attività di questo enzima può essere modificata sia da farmaci, nel trattamento di malattie quali Miastenia gravis e l'Alzheimer, sia da tossine naturali. Per esempio nella diagnosi della miastenia gravis al soggetto viene inoculato un farmaco, la piridostigmina, che con la sua inibizione dell'enzima porta un leggero potenziamento delle facoltà motorie confermando l'ipotesi di diagnosi supposta.},

	abstract = {{ObjectiveDementia} is an important cause of mortality and, with the ageing population and increasing prevalence of dementia, reliable data on prognosis and survival will be of interest to patients and caregivers as well as providers and commissioners of health and social care. A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the rates of survival in dementia and Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) and to identify factors that are or are not predictive of mortality in dementia and {AD}. {MethodsRelevant} articles on mortality in dementia were identified following a search of several electronic databases from 1990 to September 2012. Inclusion criteria were reports on prospective community or clinic based cohorts published in English since 1990, to reflect more recent recognition of possible predictors. {ResultsMedian} survival time from age of onset of dementia ranges from 3.3 to 11.7years, with most studies in the 7 to 10-year period. Median survival time from age of disease diagnosis ranges from 3.2 to 6.6years for dementia or {AD} cohorts as a whole. Age was consistently reported as a predictor of mortality, with male gender a less consistent predictor. Increased disease severity and functional impairment were often associated with mortality. {ConclusionsSubstantial} heterogeneity in the design of included studies limits the ability to prognosticate for individual patients. However, it is clear that dementia and {AD} are associated with significant mortality. Reasons for the increased mortality are not established. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
